# CS-320-Software-Test-Automation-and-QA

I can ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure by practicing attention to detail as I write, and by using both static and dynamic testing techniques to catch errors pre and post compilation. When it comes to user needs, I interpret them by gaining a strong foundation of understanding first. I do that by asking questions, researching needs, and brainstorming solutions. I then incorporate them into a program by trying a few things at a time to see what works, incorporating feedback and learning from mistakes, and continuing to build on it until it comes together. Designing software takes a lot of time, especially for beginners. I approach it by using best practices from those who have come before me, like my Senior Engineers in the workplace or my Professor in the classroom. I also write personal notes around what I am trying to achieve, what functions will apply, and parts of the language doc that will help me to bring it all together.
